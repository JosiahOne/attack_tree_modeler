# attack_tree_modeler

This is a WIP project used which will be used to create attack trees which are
conformant with the trees created with ADTool2: https://github.com/tahti/ADTool2

It runs as a single website and can be exported (and imported) as an XML file.
Both ADTool2 and attack_tree_modeler are capable of opening and editing these
files.
